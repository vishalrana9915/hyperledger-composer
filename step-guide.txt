Start up guide for hyperledger composer.



HyperLedger fabric using HyperLedger-composer and playground:

Step 1: we need to setup the developemnent requirements and install all the prerequisites.
step 2: docker containers need to be up.
step 3: we need to start the fabric using ./startFabrics.sh and followed by ./createPeerAdminCard.sh


for local testing and setup we can make use of YO package provided by npm :
    - yo hyperledger-composer
    - This command is followed by no of questions and select each answer carefully.    




We need to create a .bna (business network archive) file which is the combination of 4 sections:
 - model.cto (modeling the structure of the project requirements)
 - query.qry(contains query for the ledger)
 - script.js (contains the logic)
 - accesscontrol.acs(acess controls details)

 - composer archive create -t dir -n .


After creating the .bna file we need to deploy it to the fabric;
    Install composer runtime:
        - composer network install --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --archiveFile block-track@0.0.1.bna
    Deploy the business network:
        - sudo composer network start --networkName block-track --networkVersion 0.0.1 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --file networkadmin.card
    Import the network administrator identity as a usable business network card
        - composer card import --file networkadmin.card
    Checking the card:
        - composer network ping --card admin@block-track

    Start the RESTful API:
        - composer-rest-server
        Followed by simple steps and you can have access to your rest api's
    
    Start building the front end:
